''' Task 1:
   String variable, month, stores a month. Int variable, day, stores a day. Generate a date and then use if-statements to figure out what season it is. Store the season in string variable, season.

''' Task 2:
  Keep track of textbooks you have bought in the school store. Integer textbooks keeps track of the number of textbooks bought. Float price shows the price of the textbook. Boolean buy keeps track of if you are buying textbooks. Every time you buy a textbook, the number of textbooks go up by 1 and the price is added to the total.
